# TransferWise – A Billion-Dollar Idea

## Overview & Origin

TransferWise is the genesis of two fintech entrepreneurs, Kristo Kaarmann and Taavet Hinrikus, who stumbled upon an idea out of their own personal experience with trying to transfer money between countries. Hinrikus, originally from Estonia, but living in the UK, was regularly needing to transfer money from an account in Estonia to his account in the UK. Each time he transferred money the attached cost was generally as high as 5% of the transfer amount. Kaarman who was also working in the UK, was regularly having to transfer money to Estonia to cover mortgage payments. Kaarman and Hinrikus came up with the genius idea of covering each others expenses to cut out the money transfer costs. Kaarman used his money in the UK to transfer to Hinrikus, while Hinrikus in Estonia used his money to cover payment of Kaarman’s expenses. Hinrikus and Kaarman realized they had found a system that had saved themselves thousands of pounds in fees (3). From this idea they went on to build the company TransferWise that allows individuals from many counties to save while transferring money between countries. Created in 2011, the company is UK based with a premise that allows for the flow of money around country borders at a lower cost than through traditional money transfer sources (11).

On its website, Transferwise states it transfers $6 billion every month through its business platform. They have served 9 million customers and saved their customers $1.5 billion every year. TransferWise has 14 offices in various countries around the world. Their stated mission is to provide transparency to financial transactions by charging minimum fees, no hidden fees, and true exchange rates (6). 

TransferWise is a privately held company. They have had 11 rounds of funding in the Secondary Market and have raised 1.1B, with the last round of funding occurring in July 2020. TransferWise has funding from 34 investors such as Fidelity, LocalGlobe, Virgin Group, Richard Branson, Peter Theil, BlackRock, Lone Pine Capital and Lead Edge Capital (8). TransferWise has a current market valuation of $5 billion. For the fiscal year 2020 revenue is 302.6 million. Revenue growth between 2019 – 2020 is 69% (12).

## Business Activities

TransferWise has set up its own accounts in 70 countries throughout the world over Europe, Asia, North America, Oceania, and Africa covering 54 different currencies. It is a global tech company with the goal of moving money around the world in the most efficient cost effect way.  An individual pays into a TransferWise account in their chosen country and TransferWise will then pay the designated recipient (using mid market exchange rates) from a TransferWise account in the other country. TransferWise is committed to charging the lowest service fees possible and has a service goal of providing full transparency of fees. There are no hidden fees or inflated exchange rates (6). TransferWise uses a peer to peer money transfer/currency exchange system that allows individuals and business to send money between countries. It is the world’s first peer to peer money transfer company(10). 

The advantage of using TransferWise is the cost savings for the consumer. Transferring money via the bank is expensive as there is a fee attached to the transfer of money and conversion to a different currency. There is a hidden margin fee the bank takes in the process of the conversion. The below diagram offers a visual representation of the difference between the traditional money transfer system and the TransferWise system.

In 2018 TransferWise added an additional product – TransferWise debit MasterCard. This cross-currency card allows the customer to spend utilizing the real exchange rate. The consumer can receive and spend money in the country similar to a local bank account holder creating a borderless account for the holder in which they can instantly spend in 54 different countries. In November 2020 Finxact Marketplace announced it was adding TransferWise as a member thus giving banks and credit unions the opportunity to offer their customers access to alternative international money transfer services (13).  TransferWise is looking to grow and integrate its service platform within the traditional banking system. Currently it has entered into arrangements with 12 banks that allow their customers to access TransferWise from their banking app (9).

## Landscape

TransferWise functions within the large and competitive space of financial services focused on international money transfer/payments. Approximately $530 billion is transferred yearly and since 2000 there has been a year over year growth rate of 10.4% (2). Other major competitors in the same space as TransferWise are: XE Money Transfer, TorFx, OFX, WorldFirst, Currency Fair, WorldRemit, MoneyGram, Western Union, CurrenciesDirect, PayPal/Xoom, Payoneer, Transfast, Rio Money Transfer, OrbitRemit, Paysera, Skrill, Travelex, Revolut, Qonto, Remitly, Azimo, or through the traditional banking system (1). 

Since 2008 fees associated with the transfer of money have decreased due to competition within the money transfer market as well as pressure from international organizations (UN, G20) to lower the rates. Western Union leads the pack and handles over $70 billion in transfers yearly, however, its revenue growth has stalled due to increasing downward pressure on service fees. With increasing pressure on service fee margins money transfer companies are looking for other ways to attract and keep customers and need to differentiate themselves in the value-added services they offer such as payroll services, virtual bank accounts and prepaid debit cards (2). Traditionally, the money transfer process has been costly and cumbersome. However, innovations in the industry have meant individuals can now access a better selection of services that are faster and cheaper.

## Results

TransferWise has achieved strong performance and growth in the 10 years since its inception. It has created a successful business model which continues to increase its market share and profitability. Within Europe it has now established itself as the most valuable fintech start up (14). TransferWise continues to grow its customer base (from 6 million customers in September 2019 to 8 million in July 2020) and expand its services.  It has captured 10% of the UK market.  From 2019 to 2020 annual profit more than doubled from £10.1 million in 2019 to £20.4 million in March 31, 2020 as they continue to attract millions of new customers (14).  26% of TransferWise users are from the US. 52% of customers are from Europe and 22% are from other world locations (12).

## Recommendations

TransferWise has successfully entered the international money transfer market. It has been able to capture business, build revenues and its customer base year over year. It has built a successful platform both in scale and in the effective use of technology. TransferWise is still in a strong growth phase. To build and retain customer loyalty TransferWise needs to continue to differentiate itself from others in the money transfer field by expanding services and utilizing technology to lower costs and improve service. The addition of the “borderless account” positions TransferWise to move further into the banking space and an opportunity to offer more service options to customers. Additionally, continuing to build strategic partnerships within the banking system will give TransferWise reach to an expanded customer base. TransferWise needs to continue to focus on building brand loyalty and trust by being a transparent and reliable money transfer service (2).
